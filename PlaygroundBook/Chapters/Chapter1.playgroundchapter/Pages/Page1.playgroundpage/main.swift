//: Welcome to **Shader Node Editor**, a Swift Playground that enables you to compose & preview shader effects in an easy way on your iPad Pro.
//: # Requirements
//: ‚ÄºÔ∏è Before reading texts below, please first follow instructions on the running playground panel to enable certain permissions, so you can use Shader Node Editor freely in later pages.
//: # üí° Introduction
//: ## What's a shader?
//:
//: > In computer graphics, a shader is a type of computer program originally used for shading in 3D scenes (the production of appropriate levels of light, darkness, and color in a rendered image). They now perform a variety of specialized functions in various fields within the category of computer graphics special effects, or else do video post-processing unrelated to shading, or even perform functions unrelated to graphics at all. (Wikipedia)
//:
//: You are probably using Shaders all the time but you didn't notice them when you were applying filters on Instagram or playing video games on your iPad. What's more, Shaders are now used in Machine Learning to accelerate the learning process (compute shaders, specifically), and all these are achieved with only pure mathematical expressions, what marvelous engineering!
//:
//: However, shader might be hard to learn at first due to its parallel computing nature. The program you wrote would be executed thousands of times in one frame with different output values, which is an abstract concept and people sometimes don't get it. That's why Shader Node Editor comes to rescue. With a node-based user interface, you can compose shaders in both feedback-rich and visual-pleasing way, and it is always real-time so you don't need to wait for a debug build.
//:
//: Without further due, let's dive into Shader programming with Shader Node Editor, my node-based expression editor written in Swift (`UIKit Dynamics`, `SwiftUI`, `SpriteKit`)!
